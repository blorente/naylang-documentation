abstract: >
    Naylang is an Open Source REPL interpreter and debugger for a subset of the Grace programming language, written entirely in modern C++. It is structured as a Visitor-based interpreter, and introduces the Modular Visitor Pattern to the realm of programming languages. The focus of Naylang is on education for both the user and the future contributors, and thus offers extensive test coverage and simple implementations of the most common implementation techniques. It features the ANTLRv4 C++ target for parsing direct left-recursive grammars.
